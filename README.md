## Project Overview

The **Spam Detector** project is designed to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bychok/classification-challenge.git
cd spam-detector
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook spam_detector.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Conclusions

### Evaluate the Models

- Logistic Regression: 0.9262
- Random Forest Classifier: 0.9598

Based on the accuracy scores, the Random Forest Classifier model (0.9598) outperformed the Logistic Regression model (0.9262). This suggests that the Random Forest Classifier was better at predicting the labels in the testing data.

I predicted that the Random Forest Classifier would perform better due to its ability to handle complex interactions between features and its robustness to overfitting. The results confirm my prediction, indicating that the Random Forest Classifier was able to capture more subtle patterns in the data and make more accurate predictions.

Overall, these results highlight the importance of exploring different models and techniques to find the best approach for a given problem.
